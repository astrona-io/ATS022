# Prerequisites

- The `astrona` command-line tool, installed and working (`astrona check` passes).
- A container engine that kind can use (Podman or Docker) with about 2 GiB of free memory.
- `kubectl`.
- You know how to read the events of a PersistentVolumeClaim with `kubectl describe pvc`.

The lab starts a single-node kind cluster (Kubernetes 1.35) with two Pending claims and their Pods in the namespace `starfleet`.
